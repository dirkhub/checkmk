The option should show the possible folders the host could be moved to but
ended up in perpetual loading and an entry like "AttributeError: 'list' object
has no attribute 'split'" in ~/var/log/web.log, e.g. for normal monitoring
users.

Moving the host via checkbox and option "Hosts" - "Move to other folder" was
still possible.
