The monolithic file <tt>cmk/gui/plugins/wato/datasource_programs.py</tt> has been partially split up
into smaller files in the folder <tt>datasource_programs</tt>. Hence, any customization (single
files and MKPs) containing imports from <tt>cmk/gui/plugins/wato/datasource_programs.py</tt> might
have to be adjusted. The new import path is probably
<tt>cmk.gui.plugins.wato.datasource_programs.common</tt>.
