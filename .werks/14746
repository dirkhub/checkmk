If Business Intelligence views were exported via "Export" - "Export CSV" or
"Export JSON" the exported files contained an exception like "Exception:
Painter 'aggr_treestate' returned invalid result".

This bug was introduced with werk #13879 in 2.1.0b6 that fixed the export of
labels in views but set to tight restrictions for the painter format.
