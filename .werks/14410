When using service labels to match rulesets the web UI and checking engine disagreed if a ruleset should be applied.
The UI did not correctly show rule matches for services with discovered labels.
However, the checking engine correctly matches and applies rules based on discovered or assigned service labels.

This has been fixed now. The UI now correctly shows rule matches for discovered service labels.
