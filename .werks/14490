When the global setting "Maximum concurrent Checkmk checkers" (topic "Monitoring core") is set to
a value greater than the number of available CPUs, users are now warned on the "Activate pending
changes" page. This is done because the checker processes are most effective when each checker
gets a dedicated CPU. Users can, however, ignore this warning and keep their setting.
