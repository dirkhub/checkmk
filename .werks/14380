Hashes of passwords displayed in the audit log are now calculated using a keyed hash function.

Previously, a truncated SHA256 hash of the password was displayed. While this is not an issue for long, randomly generated passwords, the hashes of weak passwords could have been reversed using brute-force.
Passwords are now hashed using HMAC with a random key that is not persisted. Note that, as a consequence, users will not be able to recognize or validate password hashes in the audit log.
