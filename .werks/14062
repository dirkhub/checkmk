Title: fileinfo: Fix state for "Out of relevant time of day"
Class: fix

Version: 2.1.0p7

After the migration to the new check API in version 2.1.0, fileinfo
check didn't calculate the CheckMk state correctly. Levels were
applied even when checked outside of relevant time of day.
Now, state will always be OK if outside of relevant time period.
