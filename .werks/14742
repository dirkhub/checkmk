Title: Fix combined search for tag groups

If you used "tg:" for tag groups in combined searches, no results were shown,
even if the search would match.
This feature was broken since at least version 1.6.

You can now use combined searches like "s: MY_SERVICE tg: MY_TAG" in the
monitoring search and quicksearch again.
