Title: Fix title of Forecast graphs

If new Forecast graphs were saved with the option "Save & go to Forecast graph"
or existing graphs were edited via "Edit model", the defined titel was
overwritten with "HOSTNAME - SERVICEDESCRIPTION".

We are sorry but existing Forecast graphs have to be saved again with the
intended title.
