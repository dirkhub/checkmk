 The special agent mobileiron queries the mobileiron cloud instance
 through the REST API and then displays the status of each
 device via the piggyback mechanism.

 This check monitors the compliance state of each device in mobileiron.

 The service state depends on the number of policy violations
 and the compliance state of the device.
 You can configure the policy_violation_levels with params.
 The default parameters are: {WARN} for 2 policy violations and {CRIT} for 3.
